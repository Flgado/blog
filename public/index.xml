&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to my AWS journey! In this blog, I’ll be diving into a real-time sentiment analysis pipeline built with AWS. As I continue working towards my AWS Developer Associate certification, I’m excited to share what I’ve learned so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll guide you through how to use AWS services like Lambda, Comprehend, Firehose, and QuickSight to transform raw data into actionable insights in real-time. Plus, I’ll be deploying everything using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model), so you can see just how easy it is to build and manage serverless applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deploying a Secure API Using AWS SAM and Cognito Made Easy</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my journey toward earning the AWS Certified Developer certification, I’ve been diving into various AWS services. In this blog, I’ll guide you through setting up a secure API with AWS Cognito for authentication and API Gateway to handle requests. We’ll leverage AWS Lambda to process these API calls, creating a fully serverless architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll also walk you through how to easily deploy both the API and Cognito configuration using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) and explain how the API integrates with Cognito for authentication. Additionally, I’ll show you how to use the API to interact with other AWS services, such as publishing messages to AWS IoT MQTT and retrieving images from S3 buckets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
