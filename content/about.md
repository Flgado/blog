João Folgado is a 30-year-old computer engineer from Portugal, currently living in Castelo Branco. Is a computer engineer currently working on AWS infrastructure, authentication services, and backend development with Go (Golang). With a strong background in distributed systems, he is passionate about building scalable, efficient solutions that serve the needs of modern platforms.

In addition to his professional work, João is pursuing a Master’s degree in Cybersecurity, where his current focus is on eBPF and security observability. This cutting-edge area of research aligns with his future ambitions to specialize in cybersecurity, a field he is deeply passionate about and aims to shape with his contributions.

Before transitioning fully into tech, João spent 6 years serving in the Portuguese Air Force, an experience that not only honed his discipline but also deepened his understanding of security at an operational level—something that now informs his approach to cybersecurity.

Outside of work, João is an avid traveler who loves exploring new cultures and destinations. He is also a dedicated athlete, currently training for a triathlon, combining his love for sports with his goal-oriented mindset.
