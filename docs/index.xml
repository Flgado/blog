      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my journey toward earning the AWS Certified Developer certification, I’ve been diving into various AWS services. In this blog, I’ll guide you through setting up a secure API with AWS Cognito for authentication and API Gateway to handle requests. We’ll leverage AWS Lambda to process these API calls, creating a fully serverless architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll also walk you through how to easily deploy both the API and Cognito configuration using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) and explain how the API integrates with Cognito for authentication. Additionally, I’ll show you how to use the API to interact with other AWS services, such as publishing messages to AWS IoT MQTT and retrieving images from S3 buckets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
